## About

After authorizing, users can view their most listened to artists and tracks from various timeframes in a visually attractive style. The site went viral on Facebook and has recieved acclaim from [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/visualify) and [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/visualify-shows-off-your-spotify-listening-habits-trac-1787766510).

## Motivation

Spotify releases information about user's listening habits once a year in December. For the rest of the year, user's have no method to keep track of their most popular artists and tracks. Visualify uses the Spotify API to grab this information and display it to users year round.
