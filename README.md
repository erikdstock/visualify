# Visualify

Check it out live at [visualify.xyz](http://visualify.xyz).

Visualify is a web app built on Meteor.js, Bootstrap 4, and the Spotify API. After authorizing it you can view your most listened to artists and tracks from various timeframes. I built it on my flight back home from college (got to love JetBlue's free Wifi).

Try it out! Your top artists might even surprise you...
