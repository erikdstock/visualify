## About

Visualify is a web app built on Meteor.js, Bootstrap 4, and the Spotify API. After authorizing it users can view their most listened to artists and tracks from various timeframes in a visually attractive style.

## Motivation

Spotify releases information about user's listening habits once a year in December. For the rest of the year, user's have no method to keep track of their most popular artists and tracks. Visualify uses the Spotify API to grab this information and display it to users.
